## [Calculator](https://rolandsruja.github.io/calculator/)
Simple calculator mad by using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS for [The Odin Projects calculator challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

Used iOS calculator as a functionality example, although did not replicate it for 100%. (Possibly contains some bugs ðŸ«£)
